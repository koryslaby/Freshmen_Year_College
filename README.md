# Freshmen_Year_College
This Repository contains some of the first python code Ive wrote. Varies files show my attempt at learning how to create
functions and classes. One thing I struggled for while with was object oriented programing and how inheritence worked. 
This is also my first experince with github, pushing and pulling to repositories through the command line.
# Environmental_Science_Project
This folder contains a project I did for my enviromental science class. It acts as a servey program and in the end gives you
a score of how enviromental you are. This project is where I first learned how to break up a project into smaller files and 
then import them when needed.
